# BlueSky go-live commandline tool

This is barebones, proof of concept. But aims to be more useful than the manual method

- The first time you run it, it will generate a default config file. Edit this and fill in your details
- *Use an app password, not your main BlueSky password* - Settings -> Privacy and Security -> App Passwords
- Title can be whatever you like default is e.g. LumKitty - Twitch
- Description, BSky asks for it but I don't think they use it, let me know if you actually see this anywhere
- No need to specify a duration, this app will continually refresh your live status, when you hit enter to end the app it will mark you as not being live
- If you kill the app, your live status will end in 1-2 minutes
- No responsibility if this doesn't work and you lose a million viewers. This app is rough AF and you use it at your own risk
